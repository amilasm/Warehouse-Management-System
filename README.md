#### Brief Description of Project - Ceylon foods pvt ltd maintains a large warehouse. Suppliers supply raw materials and factories send back the finished product to the warehouse and then the warehouse dispatches products when sales agents order products. Currently the company maintains a Microsoft excel based manual system for the warehouse operations. It holds inventory data, order data, labour data, supplier data, agent data and so on. This method is very inefficient.As a client requirement , we proposed a cloud based warehouse management system for Ceylon foods pvt ltd.


#### Technologies used - MERN Stack
